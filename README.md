# Skin Lesion Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of my **MSCS Thesis: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Early Skin Lesion Detection**.  
The work focuses on **skin cancer classification** (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.) using dermoscopic images and deep learning.

---

## üìå Objectives
- Perform a **comparative analysis** of multiple CNN architectures (ResNet50, AlexNet, InceptionV3, GoogLeNet).  
- Evaluate performance across **two benchmark datasets**: ISIC 2019 and HAM10000.  
- Identify the **best-performing model** for accurate and early detection of skin lesions.  
- Ensure **robustness** by applying 5-fold cross-validation and **statistical significance testing (paired t-tests, p < 0.05)**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Datasets
The experiments were conducted on two public datasets:

1. **[ISIC 2019](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/)**  
   - Contains thousands of dermoscopic images for multiple skin lesion categories.  

2. **[HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)**  
   - Large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images with 7 skin lesion classes.
